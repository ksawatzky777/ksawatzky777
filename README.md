### About me:
Hi, I'm Kevin, a 4th year nuclear engineering student (minoring in computational science) in the [FESNS](https://nuclear.ontariotechu.ca/index.php) at the [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/). I'm passionate about reactor physics, fluid mechanics and computational sciences (especially discretization schemes for solving partial differential equations). When I'm not studying, I'm working on various projects!

### Current Projects:

- [FinDPyNe](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/FinDPyNE): **Fin**ite **D**ifference **Py**thon **Ne**tronics. A C++ program with python bindings designed to solve the transient and steady-state n-group neutron diffusion equation. It is intended to function an alternative to DRAGON for undergraduate students in nuclear engineering, incorperating a rudimentary GUI to make it more approachable and user-friendly. Currently a work in progress.

- Gnat: **G**eneric **n**eutron **a**ctivation **t**oolkit, which aims to implement neutron activation in a manner which can be easily coupled to neutron transport solvers through the MOOSE finite element framework. Gnat also aims to implement n-group neutron diffusion as a baseline. Gnat is currently a work in progress.

- [Californium](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/Californium): A Discord bot to solve simple problems in reactor physics. Built to learn Discord.py, currently a work in progress.

### Past Projects

- [CARIBOU](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/caribou): A multiphysics transport code for the environmental assessment of nuclear accidents. My contributions to CARIBOU are the beginnings of the atmospheric transport scheme, weather data formatting scripts and coupling of the trasport scheme to global climate data.
