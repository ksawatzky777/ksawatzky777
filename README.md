### About me:
Hi, I'm Kevin, a 4th year nuclear engineering student (minoring in computational science) in the [FESNS](https://nuclear.ontariotechu.ca/index.php) at the [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/). I'm passionate about reactor physics, fluid mechanics and computational sciences (especially discretization schemes for solving partial differential equations). When I'm not studying, I'm working on various projects!

### Current Projects:

- [FinDPyNe](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/FinDPyNE): **Fin**ite **D**ifference **Py**thon **Ne**tronics. A python program designed to solve the transient and steady-state n-group neutron diffusion equation. It is intended to function an alternative to DRAGON for undergraduate students in nuclear engineering, incorperating a rudimentary GUI to make it more approachable and user-friendly. Currently a work in progress.

- Neutron activation toolkit: An unnamed MOOSE-based application for computing activation product concentrations in structural components of nuclear reactors. Aims to couple multi-group neutron diffusion with neutron activation. [Closed source, for now]

### Past Projects

- [CARIBOU](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/caribou): A multiphysics transport code for the environmental assessment of nuclear accidents, my contribution to CARIBOU was the data formatting scheme and the transport model.
