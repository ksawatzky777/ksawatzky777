## Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

### About me:
I'm Kevin, a 4th year nuclear engineering student in the [FESNS](https://nuclear.ontariotechu.ca/index.php) at the [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/). I'm passionate about reactor physics, fluid mechanics and computational sciences (especially the finite element method). When I'm not studying, I'm working on various projects!

### Current Projects:

- [CARIBOU](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/caribou): A multiphysics transport code for the environmental assessment of nuclear accidents. My work on CARIBOU was supported by a [USRA grant](https://research.ontariotechu.ca/students/undergraduate-research-awards.php) and supervised by [Dr. Kirk Atkinson](https://nuclear.ontariotechu.ca/people/faculty/dr-kirk-atkinson.php). I occasionally still contribute to CARIBOU's developement, although the project has been passed on to others. [Open source]

- FinDPyNe: **Fin**ite **D**ifference **Py**thon **Ne**tronics. A python program designed to solve the transient and steady-state 2-group neutron diffusion equation. It is intended to function an alternative to DRAGON for undergraduate students in nuclear engineering, incorperating a rudimentary GUI to make it more approachable and user-friendly. Currently a work in progress. [Closed source, for now]

- Neutron activation toolkit: An unnamed MOOSE-based application for computing activation product concentrations in structural components of nuclear reactors. Aims to couple multi-group neutron diffusion with neutron activation. [Closed source, for now]
